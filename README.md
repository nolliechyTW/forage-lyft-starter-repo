# Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program
This repository contains the code for the Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program from Lyft. The program focused on various aspects of back-end engineering, including software architecture, refactoring, unit testing, and test-driven development.

## Skills Learned
Throughout this program, I acquired the following skills:

1. Software Architecture: I learned how to design clean and efficient architectures for messy components, ensuring scalability and maintainability. This involved analyzing the existing system, identifying areas for improvement, and proposing a well-structured design.

2. Refactoring: I gained expertise in refactoring code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance. I learned how to identify code smells, apply appropriate design patterns, and write clean, modular code.

3. Unit Testing: I became proficient in writing unit tests for the codebase, ensuring that individual components and functions work as expected. I learned how to use testing frameworks and techniques to verify the correctness of the code and identify potential bugs or regressions.

4. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP): Contains code examples and implementations showcasing the application of OOP principles. It includes classes, inheritance, and other OOP concepts relevant to the back-end engineering domain.

5. Test-Driven Development (TDD): I practiced the principles of TDD by writing tests before implementing new functionality. This approach helped me in designing clear requirements, improving code quality, and maintaining a robust test suite.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Lyft for providing this Back-End Engineering Virtual Experience Program, which has significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge in software architecture, refactoring, unit testing, and test-driven development.
